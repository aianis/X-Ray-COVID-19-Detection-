# X-Ray COVID-19 Detection

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for detecting COVID-19 in X-ray scans. Users can upload X-ray images, and the application will use a trained CNN model to predict whether the image indicates a positive or negative COVID-19 case.

This project uses the following dependencies:

- streamlit==1.5.0
- tensorflow==2.5.0
- opencv-python-headless==4.5.2.54
- numpy==1.23.4
- Pillow==9.0.0

## Installation
